# Discord Bot for the official Make School discord server

## Set up:

Before setting up, make sure you have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed.

Before working on this project, consider checking out this [tutorial on using discord.js](https://discordjs.guide/) - for the time being, this tutorial is only useful until 'Commands with user inputs.' We will move further with the project at a later date. At that point, more of the tutorial will be useful so feel free to read ahead!

1. Clone this repository onto your local machine using git CLI: `git clone git@github.com:Dino-Martinez/Make-School-Discord-Bot.git`
2. CD into the project root directory `/Make-School-Bot`
3. Install dependencies/style guides using `npm ci`
4. Make sure you switch to the dev branch before making any changes `git checkout -b dev`
5. <strong> Before pushing to github, make sure you enforce styling: </strong>
   - Run `npm run lint <file_path>` to receive styling suggestions.
   - Run `npm run fix <file_path>` to automatically fix incorrect styling. Note: this will not always fix everything, you may have to fix certain things manually.
